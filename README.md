# About:
This is just a dummy project where i try to play around and mess around abit with shadcn. In it i used React.js, Typescript and Tailwindcss. Might add more shadcn components later if i have some free time on my hands again.

# Start:
To start the project, get to the root directory of the project and then type npm run dev to start the project. Also please note that there is a mock database here. to spin that up, you can open another terminal and enter the root directory of the project and type: npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8080. This will start up the mock server.
